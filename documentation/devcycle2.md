# Dev Cycle 2



## Goals

My goals for this dev cycle are to use the sprite generated in the previous cycle and move it around the screen using arrow keys, as well as giving the user the ability to move the sprite with the WASD keys (the standard for gaming when using a keyboard.)

The user should also have a function that will cause the sprite to jump, moving upwards before lowering down onto the bottom of the stage.
